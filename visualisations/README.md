# PowerBI Exploratory Data Model and Prototype

## Overview

This folder contains the following files:

1. **Data Model File**: A conceptual data model for designing the relationships between tables in PowerBI.
   - **Filename**: `datamodel_powerBI.png`
   - **Purpose**: To establish the structure and relationships of data tables for a PowerBI dashboard.
   
2. **Dashboard Prototype Sketch**: A rough sketch of filters, sliders, and visuals in PowerBI.
   - **Filename**: `powerBI_dashboard_rough-sketch_v1.png`
   - **Purpose**: To demonstrate a prototype design of filters and visuals for quick exploration.

## Purpose

The files in this repository are for **exploratory purposes**. They serve as a foundation for:

- Designing and iterating on the **data model** using selected CSV files.
- Rapid prototyping of **filters** and **visuals** available in PowerBI.
- Quick evaluations of visual layouts and functionality for effective data storytelling.

## Next Steps

The next phases of this project include:

1. **Python Visualizations**:
   - Detailed visualizations and data summaries will be created using Python.
   - Python will be used to perform advanced analysis and prototype the visuals before final implementation.

2. **Final PowerBI Dashboard**:
   - The refined and proper visuals will be created directly in PowerBI.
   - The goal is to ensure a seamless and insightful end-user experience.

### Notes

- These files are **not** the final deliverables but are part of the iterative design process.
- The finalized data model and PowerBI visuals will be developed after thorough exploration and prototyping.
